## Reflection

This is a personal project that was built during Module 3 at Turing School of Software and Design.

I wanted to build an application that challenged my knowledge of React, APIs, and basic javascript. While I expected the most difficult part of this project would be the React side, it was not. The most challenging portion of this project was selecting the necessary 'key' 'value' pairs that contained the data I wanted to display to the page.

Additionally, not all the information on a single page was retrieved in a one API request. This presented the challenge of sending multiple requests, while balancing proper passage of props to keep performance high.
